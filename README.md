## About The Project 

This project aims to visualize the creative work of famous painters and look at it through the prism of color. 
Each digital portrait shows the dominant colors of the author's paintings and provides detailed information about the canvas after a click.

 In addition, there are filters if someone is interested in a specific movement or century.

Our website has a pedagogical purpose too. It may be a great way to study art playfully. Moreover, there is an attempt to broaden the digital humanities practices.
