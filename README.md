# Digital Portraits
This project aims to visualize the creative work of famous painters and look at it through the prism of color. 
Each digital portrait shows the dominant colors of author's paintings and provides detailed information about the canvas after a click.
The idea for this project was inspired by the work “The Colors of Motion” (https://thecolorsofmotion.com/) by Charlie Clark, who created the fun visualization of colors in movies. 
However, our website has a pedagogical purpose too. It may be a great way to study art playfully. Moreover, there is an attempt to broaden the digital humanities practices.
